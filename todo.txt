Add in the ability to preview the before and after of the selected text.
    - After the user has initially entered in everything, there is a screen that
    shows them what they have entered, along with the option to cancel / preview
    - This will be two side by side windows just below the main body of the
    code.
    - Once the user has specified the initial and final values, a call will be
    made to the CLI to work out what needs to be changed
    - Add in a confirm screen after the preview
